Action (physically doing something) triggers psychological movement. It will help you move through the pain that you are feeling.

EOS 0.0 0 20 I have a friend who did get it and almost died. He is 40 and pretty healthy. His wife and daughter got it too. They just had flu-like symptoms, but he was in the hospital for 9 days. EOS 0.0 0 21 That was almost 3 months ago and he is still feeling the effects of it.  EOS 1.0 1 22 [Other] So to recap, find a good friend, get exercise, eat well, talk to people who will try to understand you. And of course, pray. The survival rate is 99.996% so the fact that you know no one who died is good news. I had flu like symptoms before this all happened and i still have a cough. They spray the skies too, so i try to not live in fear. There are a lot of consequences to fear, your heart beats faster, you stress yourself out, so it's important to not focus on negativity for too long.

EOS 1.0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions] Well, everyone handles stressful situations differently, but there are some things you can do or try that might help. If you prepare as much as possible in the time that you have, you can be confident that you have done your best, and that is all that matters. You can decide that while you would like to get this new job, the world will not end if you don't get it, and you will worry less and have less stress. Also there is the classic technique of picturing your interviewer in their underwear. It makes them seem less imposing, and you can feel more confident.

Sometimes when one let's their friends know what is really bothering them makes the friends trust them more given that they are open with them and could tell them what they feel deep inside. That's what true friendship is about. It works wonders

Losing your job is a very rough thing to go through, i'm sorry that happened to you. Feeling constantly at red alert is taxing both mentally and physically.  EOS 1.0 1 6 [Self-disclosure] There is a concept called maslow's hierarchy of needs, and sometimes i find it useful to think about if my needs are being met, and which is lacking. Which is to say, obviously financial security is your primary need at the moment, but there are other needs you must attend to as well, including your physical comforts.

EOS 0.0 0 16 I will definitely. I just got to get up and get with it. I'm really in need of some exercise so i'll do that too. I used to paint and draw but i kind of fell off and stopped doing it. I'll get back into that too. EOS 1.0 1 17 [Reflection of feelings] Oh yeah, nothing is worse than losing joy in something you love doing. But, getting back in an active mindset helps. I used to love to have bonfires, it really was therapeutic for me but then i just lost the will to have them. Since i've been back on mturk and trying to be more active these last couple weeks, i had one on saturday and really enjoyed it. So much of the passion lost for hobbies isn't because we grow out of them, it's quite frankly because we are probably just depressed.

Definitely try tomorrow morning to get up and exercise and maybe hit the mturk hard, also hobbies definitely help and being at home is a great time to learn new skills. EOS 0.0 0 16 I will definitely. I just got to get up and get with it. I'm really in need of some exercise so i'll do that too. I used to paint and draw but i kind of fell off and stopped doing it. I'll get back into that too. EOS 0.0 1 17 [Reflection of feelings] Oh yeah, nothing is worse than losing joy in something you love doing. But, getting back in an active mindset helps. I used to love to have bonfires, it really was therapeutic for me but then i just lost the will to have them. Since i've been back on mturk and trying to be more active these last couple weeks, i had one on saturday and really enjoyed it. So much of the passion lost for hobbies isn't because we grow out of them, it's quite frankly because we are probably just depressed. EOS 0.0 0 18 I agree fully and i'm happy for you. I think i've been in some sort of depression for some time now. I stopped doing everything i loved. I used to love jogging but i stopped doing that too. I ended up gaining a lot of weight and now i don't like going anywhere or being seen at all. I'm usually 130 and i've shot up to 200. So i think if i can just get my routine down and exercise, i'll be alright. EOS 1.0 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yep for sure, just get back at it and learn to love it again. Anyways, good talking to you!

0.0 0 2 Doing great. How about yourself?  EOS 0.0 1 3 [Questions] I'm doing well how can i help you tonight? EOS 0.0 0 4 So, the issue i'm having is work-related. My son had heart surgery a few months ago. He now has a pacemaker. He's also in the middle of testing for cp. My job requires that i be around a lot of people. I always wear a mask...but sometimes the people i am with do not. Nor do they respect the 6-foot boundary. A simple cold gives my son a fever of 103. Im scared that if i continue to work, im putting him in danger. But if i stop, i can no longer afford bills.  EOS 0.0 0 5 My son just turned 2. EOS 1.0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can see where this would be frustrating. As parents our biggest goal is to keep them safe and healthy. Have you thought about having a conversation with the people you are around to inform them you'd wish they wear a mask?

But one in particular stands out. A gentleman who told me he had a medical condition and proceeded to get in my face. He got angry at my request. EOS 0.0 0 8 In my shoes, what would you do?  EOS 0.0 0 9 Because i feel like im stuck between a rock and a hard place lol  EOS 1.0 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] I understand how you feel.

I think people put too much emphasis on permanence.

I told him that if he cared about me, he would move on because thats truly what i would want him to do and i think thats what your girl would want you to do as well.

EOS 0.0 0 5 Yes. They have a military background and bark orders, and change the way i'm working without being open to conversation.  EOS 0.0 0 6 When i ask questions, they threaten my job. Telling me they "don't have to explain themselves!" as they are my supervisor. EOS 1.0 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Wow, that sounds difficult with them being so militant. Have you been able to talk to any co-workers in a similar situation?

EOS 0.0 0 8 Yes, there are two other people supervised by him. One of them is also military and new him before hand, they seem to get along great.  EOS 0.0 0 9 But my other co-worker is like me.

EOS 1.0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That sounds hard that it is so hostile at work when you trying so hard.

EOS 1.0 1 20 [Self-disclosure] When i was in a similar situation i had to go to a higher supervisor and was helped a lot. It probably is never too soon, but could be too late if you wait.

That is what has to be processed in order to move on.

EOS 1.0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions] Gotcha so not only are you frustrated with what he is doing, but you are also worried about his reputation! First of all, can i ask if he is just your friend online or if you hangout with him in person too?

He is actually a close friend and i wonder what has changed recently to make him like this. I've known him for over 20 years.  EOS 1.0 1 10 [Other] Okay i see. From personal experience, the best way to confront someone who likes to do most of their confrontations online, is in person. Since he is so used to almost "hiding" behind a screen, his feelings will be more vulnerable and real if you discuss your concerns in person.

I moved to a totally new place a few months before the pandemic  EOS 0.0 0 13 Lost the job i moved here for, most of the friends i had made needed to move back in with family, it's just a mess.  EOS 0.0 0 14 And we're on level red these days, so most businesses are closed around here.  EOS 1.0 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It's hard to be optimistic when everything seems so uncertain. I can't imagine how lonely that would feel especially in a new place.

EOS 1.0 1 20 [Other] It really isn't. That's such a hard situation to be in. I really can't think of much of a solution unfortunately.

EOS 0.0 0 7 I think that's the other thing that these lockdowns are doing; they're sucking the emotional aspects out of activities and pastimes we love. Instead of laughing or jumping with fright in theaters with everyone, we now have to do it with ourselves. Rather than cheering as an audience over a touchdown, it's now a crowd of one. It just feels robotic now.  EOS 1.0 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I agree with you, what used to be super-exciting activities now have a much more monotonous feeling.

EOS 0.0 0 10 Yeah, she went again the other day. She is doing quite a bit better. He said because of underlying conditions it may take her longer, but she is doing great. That was encouraging.  EOS 0.0 1 11 [Information] There are substantially more people recovering from covid each day despite the number of infected growing exponentially. I am sure that, with the proper care, your mother in law will make it, and so will your husband.  EOS 1.0 1 12 [Other] I am sure he will be able to find a new job soon as new business start to open, even if it's a temporary one.
